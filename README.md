# JOSSE-Dataset
Using the JIRA user interface for a couple of open-source projects, it was possible to collect many issues that meet the main research criteria. The criteria are software development tasks annotated with description, actual cost, and expert estimate. The collected data points gathered in one databased and named as JIRA Open Source Software Effort (JOSSE) Data set.
