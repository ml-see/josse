URL: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8858
 
 
   I wish to be able to write BYTES type fields to BigQuery.
   
   In BigQueryUtils (sdks/io/google-cloud-platform) when serialising a BYTES type BEAM field for BQ there is a faulty cast to java.nio.ByteBuffer while the value will always be a primitive byte array (see org.apache.beam.sdk.values.Row.Builder#verifyPrimitiveType).
   
   Trying to use BigQueryUtils when writing a BYTES field to BiqQuery will cause
   `
   java.lang.ClassCastException: [B cannot be cast to java.nio.ByteBuffer at org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.bigquery.BigQueryUtils.fromBeamField(BigQueryUtils.java:280)
   `
   and the added tests in BigQueryUtilsTest will trigger this, and the changes to BigQueryUtils intends to solve it.
