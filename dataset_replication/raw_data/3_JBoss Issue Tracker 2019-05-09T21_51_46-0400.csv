<TCPPING timeout=""3000"" initial_hosts=""192.168.0.57[7800]"" 
 port_range=""3"" num_initial_members=""3""/>

My testdriver went as follows:

1) Client joins jgroups channel
2) Server joins jgroups channel

Server sends packets to the client at short intervals of 100 ms.
Client sends packets to the server at intervals of 2000 ms. (Packets are
stuffed to be 10K)

We were interested in measuring the response times from server to client.
So Server put a timestamp send off packet to Client, client calculated the
difference. The test was done on the same machine. (Client and server on
same windows box)

We found this pattern:

1) echo SimpleUserType - receives and sends back a SimpleUserType that has 3 members of the type int, float and String
2) echo array of SimpleUserType - receives and sends back an array of SimpleUserType of any length.
3) echo Synthetic - receives and sends back a little more complex user type. This type has 3 members of the type String, SimpleUserType and an byte[]
4) get order - this use case simulates a request for a complete purchase order, taking two integer input parameters and sends back an Order object. The order object has a more complex structure that includes order header info, a customer sub-class with shipping address and billing address structures, as well as any number of line items objects. In my implementation the order object always contains 50 line items.

Thomas, because I don't have RW access to the CVS, I've attached an implementation of these wsdl's.

I've started to dig in to JBWS-75 a bit and I've decided to use Microsofts WSTest 1.1 http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/java/compare/webserviceperf/default.aspx , which is their implementation of Sun's WSTest 1.0 http://java.sun.com/developer/codesamples/webservices.html#Performance
They used Mercury's LoadRunner when they performed their tests, but this is commercial software that I don't have. I've found another software, Crosscheck Network SOAPSonar http://www.crosschecknet.com/ , they have a Personal Edition that's free. This looks pretty nice. I'll look into PustToTest as well.
","03/Nov/05 8:44 AM;thomas.diesler;Thanks for getting started on JBWS-75. 

The performance and benchmark tests should run in an automated fashion as part of an ant task. This is important because they will run as part of the jboss-labs performance regression tests.

Unfortunately, we cannot have any dependencies on third party software that we cannot distribute. What I am initially looking for is a set of ws deployments that cover common ws processing use cases. 

What immediately jumps to mind are use cases like: 

1) trivial soap messages
2) complex user types
3) array types 

I would assume that we are not the first who think about measuring ws performance. So ideally, there is a set of wsdl available somewhere that form the basis of good performance tests. If this fails, maybe there is a paper available that allows us to derive the needed set of wsdl files.

From the wsdl files we derive the deployments and the test cases.

Initially we would have a build for jbossws deployments. Later we would add corresponding deployments for JWSDP, Axis, etc to actually do a comparison.
","03/Nov/05 2:32 PM;dandiep;Just wanted to jump in here and say that I totally agree with Thomas on coming up with a set of different wsdls to cover different use cases. It would be great if they could become part of a standardized project in the community. But that may be more trouble than it is worth.","09/Nov/05 5:50 AM;anders.hedstrom;I've created 2 wsdl files, one using rpc/literal and one doc/literal messaging mode. The wsdl implements 4 use cases:

1) echo SimpleUserType - receives and sends back a SimpleUserType that has 3 members of  the type int, float and String
2) echo array of SimpleUserType - receives and sends back an array of SimpleUserType of any length. 
3) echo Synthetic - receives and sends back a little more complex user type. This type has 3 members of the type String, SimpleUserType and an byte[]
4) get order - this use case simulates a request for a complete purchase order, taking two integer input parameters and sends back an Order object. The order object has a more complex structure that includes order header info, a customer sub-class with shipping address and billing address structures, as well as any number of line items objects. In my implementation the order object always contains 50 line items.

Thomas, because I don't have RW access to the CVS, I've attached an implementation of these wsdl's.
","15/Dec/05 3:47 PM;omatzura;Hi guys!

great effort you are doing.. I've created an open-source (LPGL) soap/ws testing utility called soapui (http://www.soapui.org) which has supports automated funcationality/compliance testing (automated load/duration testing is currently in development and will be available in a couple of weeks.. ) maybe you could use this for automating the required tests? (soapui comes both with a maven plugin and a command-line runner)

let me know if I can help somehow..

regards,

Ole","10/May/06 7:07 AM;thomas.diesler;Heiko, maybe this is relevant

The plan includes identifying the content and number of modules, content and number of lab exercises, syllabus description and estimates for delivery dates for the planned module development (at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% complete stages), and identifying any development dependencies.

The plan should take into account the cross-training opportunity during March 1-2 JBossWorld event, and target the relevant content delivery by that date.

A) Items to cover in the Apache/Tomcat clustering modules
=========================================================

1) Domain Model Clustering 
   - included in mod_jk 1.2.8
   - grouping nodes in the cluster into domains
   - content based on the article to be published by Mladen

2) Shared memory implementation in mod_jk
   - Similar to what was included in JK2 implemented in mod_jk to be used with Apache2
   - Allows for the modification (add/remove) of nodes from the native Apache side
   - Similar functionality available to some extent on the Tomcat side with native connector (but lacks communication back to Apache httpd)
   - Will be included in mod_jk in Q1/2005

3) Mod_proxy
   - introduction, usage and current features
   - in the long run will replace mod_jk with equivalent features

4) Mod_jk with IIS 6
   - any relevant configuration or connector information required when used with Microsoft's IIS 6 server
   
5) Labs delivery for smooth training experience
   - work out any issues with lab delivery when using non-java software (mod_jk, Apache httpd, compilers)

6) Any already developed Tomcat native connector modules adjusted for ""JBoss Clustering"" training where reuse makes sense.",,";19/Jan/05 1:25 PM;mladen.turk;144000","Created slides for Clustering training module.

But as this config is exploded, it can be easily removed from it. For instance once it is setup, it can be removed. Another example are people that prefer to do a manual installation and thus does not need it.

- the setup.sar contains all the basic portal state, which means : tables SQL statements, insert SQL statements and also the files for Slide.

- that setup.sar must be configurable and must not be tied in particular to the module core as it will be used also for other modules (like forums). Therefore it must be done as a separate module in the build (like jboss-portal-2.0/core).

- the setup of the state must be done on the service startService() phase.

- the insertion of data must be done only if no data already exists. For instance if the portal data directory already exists, no file must be copied. Or if the tables already exist, the sql insertions must be bypassed

- the setup.sar must define an XML file format that will describe the data to setup : SQL statements and files to copy. Perhaps it could be possible to execute ANT build files from with the start, since ANT already has a lot of tasks. This is an option to explore imho

Support (optional) CRC or long hashkey generation for bodies,JBMAIL-36,12313807,12312625,Sub-task,Closed,JBMAIL,JBoss Mail ** Closed - moved to http://buni.org **,software,acoliver,CLOSED ** moved to http://buni.org,http://buni.org,Critical,Won't Fix,,acoliver,acoliver,16/Mar/05 10:59 AM,13/Dec/06 7:26 PM,09/May/19 9:51 PM,13/Dec/06 7:26 PM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"The M3 Message Store prevents bodies from being stored multiple times and allows messages to stream directly to the DB.  For large messages a line by line hash should be calculable and if it matches an existing message (this optimizes for disk size but costs performance) then the Mailbox entry is reassigned to the existing mailstore and then the new body is deleted.

Example.  

1. Assume that the following is a 64mb stream that comes in (minus headers) in duplicate for both mails (meaning we're sending the same file):

body line                          CRC/checksum/whatever

XXXXXXXXX...XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    123456
YYYYYYYYY...YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY    654321

XXXXXXXXX...XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    123456
YYYYYYYYY...YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY    654321
ZZZZZZZZZ...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ    321654

cumulative checksum accurate to at least 1/50000000

12341235125132412512  

if a ""select body_id from bodies where checksum='12341235125132412512'"" returns more than 1 result then the new body is deleted and the mailbox is assigned to the older of the two.

So the idea above is important, algorythmic and method suggestions are not (I don't know my posterior from my elbow when it comes to efficient binary similarity detection -- I'm just pretty sure that's not to be done by direct matching on content!).  

It is important that minor revisions not cause collisions.  So the 1/50000000 target for minimum collision should not be taken to mean if you send me a doc, I edit it and send it back that it drops my edits and that's okay.  It means that for this to be a viable algoyrthm if I upload the text of a speech and you upload a completely different speech and somehow the checksum comes out just right....we could have that 1/50,000,000 chance of two very different documents getting the same check, a minor revision to either should fix it.

It is also important that proper boundries be created (no chance that one time we include fuzz surrounding the body and another time we don't).",,"I have implemented storing a hash for each store item.

http://incubator.apache.org/directory/

His view:

- Directory is better for ID management than DB
  - optimized for Read Only
  - easier to replicate
  - reduced constraints on tx - less of a bottleneck

- Brought JBoss to CityStreet. Replaced WL.

- Backed by jdbm (btree store)
  - performs pretty well against sleepycat
  - but does not have as good tx support (isolation level)

- Directory server has a pluggable framework
  - LDAP plugin
  - DNS plugin
  - NTP plugin (time protocol)
 
- His ASN.1 encoders are useful for fast web services
  - http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/fastWS/Figure-2.gif
  - http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/fastWS/
  - LDAP is based on X.500, ASN.1

- Supports Kerberos, including Change Password protocol

- Looking at deploying Apache Dir as a managed service (SAR)
  - about to do that for CityStreet anyway

- Potential ideas
  - He's looking at JGroups as a replication mechanism
  - Potentially JBoss Cache data store


- Possibly interested in a relationship similar to jBPM, Tomcat
  - currently talking to investors to build proprietary (non OSS) security products
  - thinking of starting a new own venture
  - more interested in alliance with JBoss than full time job
  - anything is possible

- Immediate action plan
  - Alex will work to develop a SAR and plugin for JBossSX
  - will contribute it to JBoss under LGPL
  - this will be a proof of concept for a longer term relationship","14/Jan/05 10:56 AM;ivelin.ivanov;First phase of the discussions is complete.

Thanks for the offer, but I'm unsure if you are aware that Quartz has joined forces with the OpenSymphony group, and I'm happy with how that is turning out.  They have recently gotten some new hardware for providing better hosting services etc. and that should all be set up soon. 
If you have some specific things you wanted to talk about, I'd be more than willing to hear about it, but thought I'd let you know up-front that it would take something quite exciting to get me to shift gears at this point.   Were you thinking of ""speaking"" via telephone, IM, long emails... or what?  Probably about any time you'd want to arrange would work out.  I'm in the ""Mountain"" time zone (GMT-7).

thanks,
james

A possible example configuration would be:

Did I miss it or how come I don't see the buddy replication Jira on 1.3? I have one feedback from Greg Hinkle that WL is currently doing of which we should implement as well (may not be the first cut though).

In configuring BR policy, can we allow user to configure the buddy group to be the one that is not located in the same physical machine?

For example, we have instance A, B, C, D. A and B are in machine 1 and C and D are in machine 2. Then the buddy group of A will have to be either C or D, and vice versa. This is desired in case the machine goes down.

<Mark:>

  Hi Clebert,
     Deb has started to use your jboss spec kit.  She's hit a few problems. 
  I've taken a look, here's where we are right now.

  1.when running ant install for the first time from the
     jboss-spec kit, failure because there is no classes
     subdirectory yet in the SPECjAppServer2004 directory.

     Needed to run the ant clean command in the
     SPECjAppServer2004 directory, this created the classes
     subdirectory.

  2. We've run into some target source version issues with
      ant 1.6.2 and the SUN JDK 1.5
[root@blade2 SPECjAppServer2004]# ant
Buildfile: build.xml

compile:
     [echo] The classpath for compilation is ${JAVAX_JAR}:jars/xercesImpl.jar:jars/jakarta-regexp-1.2.jar
    [javac] Compiling 234 source files to /opt/SPECjAppServer2004/classes
    [javac] javac: target release 1.2 conflicts with default source release 1.5

     I'm doing a google search but haven't seen how to fix the target release data
     yet.  In the meantime we fell back to JDK 1.4.2

   3.  When we go to run the ant loaddb command in the SPEC kit area,
     there were classpath problems finding the JDBC.  This occurred because
     the build.xml file was looking for these definitions in config/reference.env
     To work around this problem I just copied our jboss.env defs file to
     reference.env (so I had the correct CLASSPATH definitions).
     This moved things along farther, but now I'm failing on the load because
     of connection problems to the database.  Where are the definitions for
     the database, username, password that are being used during the ant loaddb
     command?  The database looks fine (specj2004 database is created,
     schema's loaded, access granted for specj2004).   I've turned on access
     logging and don't see the request come through to connect.",,"Changed build.xml descriptor;11/Mar/05 3:14 PM;clebert.suconic;3600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3600,,,,3600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"1|hydq8f:",69016,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Mar/05 3:21 PM;clebert.suconic;Fixed/Improved build.xml and updated file at:

""It is not a requirement for an MBean of any type to be a public class.""

but then,

""An MBean must be of a public concrete class with a public constructor if it is to be instantiated by a JMX agent...""

So, if you class is not public it can not be loaded by the jboss .sar deployment mechanism, and that's normal.

I presume you could code one of your public MBeans to act as a factory and create/register the package private MBean to the MBeanServer (to be honest, I haven't tested that.)","30/Mar/05 11:58 AM;adrian.brock;Dimitris,

rather than the mbean interface method.","31/Mar/05 12:19 AM;GreyDeath;You are both right. The MBean I am talkig about is not part of a sar or -service.xml, but is registered by one of my components during startup. As such it can and is a private class.
But as Adrian pointed out, the server should access the interface and not the implementation, thus it should not be a problem. unfortuantelly the mbean server is accessing the implementation.","12/Apr/06 5:28 AM;dimitris;It's done. Look at

What I did get working was another MBeanServerBuilderImpl that is placed into the run.jar that creates a LazyMBeanServer. This starts out using the platform mbean server, and then switches to the jboss implementation as the main MBeanServer at the point where the ServerImpl normally creates its MBeanServer. The LazyMBeanServer still has to delegate requests for java.*:* object names to the platform mbean as this is what is providing all of the jconsole summary, memory, classes, etc. tabs. In the MBeans tab all of the jboss means show up along with java vm mbeans.

So we are effectively back to always creating our own MBeanServer, but we delegate to the platform implementation for the vm domain.","15/Jul/05 1:11 PM;adrian.brock;Move the discussion to the forums thread.","15/Jul/05 4:45 PM;starksm64;There is a workaround for 4.0.3.

Subject: RE: Create a compatibility matrix which tracks JBoss client vs. server class versions

Serialization should be mostly covered by the SerialVersionUIDUnitTestCase in the bundled testsuite. There needs to be basic testing of all j2ee interfaces by running a subset of the existing testuite modules against the current jboss server. This is not hard.
 
1. For each release of jboss there is a build of the release source.
2. The current jboss server branch is obtained and built.
3. The current jboss server branch binary is run as with the all configuration.
4. For each release of jboss:
    a. Run a subset of the testsuite unit tests from within the release build so that the release build binaries are used.
5. Merge the testsuite runs into a cross version compatibility matrix. The toplevel view is a simple pass/fail matrix which indicates whether all of the tests run using the x.y.z binaries passed.

We will need to test Serialization across versions or functionalities across version as well?

I'm afraid about the answer you would have, as if we have to test functionality, the amount of work will be huge. What if the Serialization works, but it the interceptor on 4.0.1 puts something different on the Marshalling that the stubs are not prepared to receive. (Just wondering some breaking in the functionality)

But If it's serialization only, we can do it fast.

No, that is not enough. We need an independent test matrix that is run as part of the nightly qa process that runs the testsuite using the x.y.z release jars against the current 4.0 branch to validate actual functional behavior. Serialization version ids are only one small part of version interop. Addition/removal of classes, and changes in implementation are the other big factors that break interop. The serialization version uid test is the only one that should be part of the normal development testsuite. The cross version matrix needs to be external and not part of the testuite cvs module so as not to bloat the download.

I can extend what you did into http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-1584

Do you think that if I compare SerialUID from previous versions against actual version would be enough to keep this compatibility matrix, or should we be doing something beyond that?

Also... I created a simple testcase that verifies if classes are defining UIDs. As cruisecontrol is broken for 4.0 now, I think people haven't look at the results. I think we still have classes not defining SerialUUID. My understanding is that this matrix is dependent of clearing SerialUUIDs first. Is that right?

All ws4ee-foo-client.jars must be deployed on a node of the same version as the testsuite running the tests. For that we could modify JBossTestCase to take a node identifier for the deploy(String nodeId, String deployments), undeploy(String nodeId, String deployments) methods.

As an optimization for the non-interop scenario the client node does not need to be started and it's Id is simply assigned to that of the server node.

=======================================================

With a byte[] of size 4000 or less, it works!

I've noticed that the exception actually originates from the Helper class that comes from Sun's JDK:

...
public abstract class OctetSeqHelper
{
    private static String  _id = ""IDL:omg.org/CORBA/OctetSeq:1.0"";

    public static void insert (org.omg.CORBA.Any a, byte[] that)
    {
	org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream out = a.create_output_stream ();
	a.type (type ());
	write (out, that);
	a.read_value (out.create_input_stream (), type ());
    }

The same class from the jacorb distribution does not perform that final ""a.read_value(...)"" line that causes the exception:

	public static void insert (org.omg.CORBA.Any any, byte[] s)
	{
		any.type (type ());
		write (any.create_output_stream (), s);
	}
	public static void write (final org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream _out, byte[] _s)
	{
		
		_out.write_long(_s.length);
		_out.write_octet_array(_s,0,_s.length);
	}

Also, if you look into jacorb's CDROutputStream, there is somewhere a hardcoded 4000 limit:

    public final void write_octet_array( final byte[] value,
                                         final int offset,
                                         final int length)
    {
        if( value != null )
        {
            if( length > 4000 )
            {
                deferredArrayQueue.add( new DeferredWriteFrame( index, offset, length, value ));
                index += length;
                deferred_writes += length;

Currently in org.jboss.ha.framework.server.FarmMemberService.deploy(), we only pass the farm directory archives to the rest of the cluster if the server is not just starting.

This task mentions one of the important cases (user copies archive to the farm deployment directory before starting the server).  The other important case is when an application is removed from a cluster but one of the server nodes is down during the operation.  When the node is brought back into the cluster, we don't want the application to be copied back into the cluster but this would happen if we simply enabled farm deployment during startup.","17/May/05 11:56 AM;smarlow;Added documentation to the Wiki (http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ClusteringFAQ) describing how users should avoid this problem by only copying archives to running server nodes.","17/May/05 11:58 AM;smarlow;I'm deferring this issue because the reported problem still occurs.

This is the offline deployment problem.  Changes to offline cluster nodes are not propagated to the cluster when the offline node rejoins the cluster.  You do not need to stop the cluster, the FAQ suggests touching/updating the ""node a"" file.  I changed the FAQ to make my intention more clear:

""I have multiple nodes running in a cluster.  On one of the nodes that were down, I copied a new application archive to the farm deployment directory and then started the server.  Why didn't the new application deploy to other cluster server nodes?

Its not supposed to, you have to start the server before updating the farm deployment directory.  After starting the server, copy the application archive again to the farm deployment directory (or touch it).  The application will then be deployed on the cluster as mentioned above.
""

The FAQ should be useful as this isn't a regression.

I mean... no instances, on references through garbage collectors, next full GC=class release.

So, why do we need additional features in the JVM unloading the class? (Sorry about my ignorance)

I was trying to use JProfiler for this, but my JVM is crashing everytime I try to take a big snapshot of the memory.

If it's not possible to use an already existent profiler for this, I was able to navigate in the HEAP using JVMTI (JVM 5), and I need to do the dirty job of analyze log files and show the heap through some simple front-end.

Also... can this task be deferred to the next version?","31/Mar/05 1:00 AM;clebert.suconic;Sorry... i meant no references through class loaders, not garbage collectors.","08/Apr/05 4:54 AM;clebert.suconic;Basically I have created a profiler for analyzing this bug.

I had to do that because I had to cross information on the classloader to find where we could have references to any specific classloader.

By definition (at least I read that somewhere on Sun's website, I think this was JVM spec) a class is only unloaded if there isn't any reference in the memory, plus you don't have any references to the classloader.

So, I'm not sure if this will release classes at GC operations, but this is the only way it could work.


So, first the analysis I've made: (open the file analysis.zip)

I - step1-classes.htm
    You will see all the classes I have loaded. In particular I deployed a WAR application twice (in particular JBoss-profiler.war).
    You will see Lorg/jboss/profiler/util/SPYConsts without any instances. I also navigated to references in both ways. Nothing holding.
II - step2-classesAtClassLoader.
    I detailed the classLoader that loaded Lorg/jboss/profiler/util/SPYConsts;. It's kind of weird but that same ClassLoader also loaded FastHashMap and PropertyMessageResourcesFactory. Well... maybe this was because of Struts as I use it in the profiler. (not sure, but maybe this is not even related)

III - step3-references-toClassLoader.htm
    I think (or at least I hope) this is the root cause:
    You have some references to the classLoader to its classes (what is expected), but you have also 34 thread references through Lorg/apache/tomcat/util/threads/ThreadWithAttribute. These are 34 references to that classloader through a single instance of ThreadWithAttribute.
    A Thread reference means a reference that sits in the stack-trace on the VM. (In another words, the thread, what could be even a ThreadLocalData or a property in a Thread).
    I read its source code and there is an array on that thread.


Well... I don't have resources to go beyond that right now, but at least I wanted to leave this analysis registered and maybe someone could have some light on this.","08/Apr/05 11:16 AM;adrian.brock;Correct, this is caused by something holding onto classloaders across deployments. 
Usually because of static collections in non redeployed classes.

Which version did you test? 
Here is a bug fix for Tomcat 5.0.28 (used in JBoss4.0.1) and ThreadAttributes
where just such a static Hashtable was causing a memory leak.
The fix was to replace the static Hashtable with a ThreadLocal.

http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33368
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-tomcat-connectors/util/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/log/SystemLogHandler.java?r1=1.5&r2=1.6

(I still don't see an example application so I'll just use the jmx console

If it is still a problem, I'll get Remy to fix it.","08/Apr/05 12:55 PM;starksm64;The analysis report is not self contained as if I try to drill into the  step3-references-toClassLoader.htm details its trying to connection to:
http://localhost:8080/jboss-profiler/memory/references.jsp?...

The analysis is nice and is something I have been thinking about adding for a while. It needs to be decoupled from the front end such that I can embedded as a debugging function of an mbean and simply access the report offline or through the jmx-console.

The current codebase for the 4.0 branch is the tomcat-5.5.9 snapshot release. The org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadWithAttributes class has no static members, but the thread pool holding the ThreadWithAttributes lives outside of the war deployment as far as I can see. We would need to know the contexts where the ClassLoader references were created to track down where the leak is.

Let's take this discussion to the profiler design forum.","08/Apr/05 2:00 PM;adrian.brock;I've run the following script for an hour without seeing any memory leak

I changed JBoss to run with -Xms32m and -Xmx32m which left about 1.7meg
of free space which the GC was able to recycle.

Next, is to verify using a profiler that there is nothing holding the ClassLoader
after redeploy and the GC has done a full gc.","08/Apr/05 4:34 PM;adrian.brock;If I redeploy the jmx-console I don't see any problem with its classloader
getting GCed.

If I redeploy the jboss-profiler.war, I don't see a full GC
clearing its classloader.

This isn't very suprising to me, since it is a Struts application.
Struts or its use of apache commons and their internal static maps
have historically caused memory leaks.","08/Apr/05 4:40 PM;clebert.suconic;I think for a small application like JMX-console you would have to re-deploy it a lot until you get into any memory boundaries.

I'm creating a docummentation for the JVMTI version I created, so I think you will be able to use the profiler yourself and look for leaks in any other application. What I would do is to order by signature. (The name is kind of hidden due to my lacking of UI skills).

Please, take a look at the jboss-profiler forum as I'm going to post locations there.","08/Apr/05 4:50 PM;adrian.brock;I did redeploy it lots of times. One hours worth of redeploys in a loop.

Well... I don't have access to Java methods through JVMTI, and plus I'm already showing the references throught the jboss-profiler memory module.

Have you tried it?","08/Apr/05 6:08 PM;clebert.suconic;I uploaded a ServletExample.zip that I was using to test.
That file was releasing Classes without any problem.

I would assume the problem is something on the jakarta's connection/struts.

The application (ServletExample) i uploaded I can even see by -verbose:gc that the classes are being unloaded.



I don't know what action we should take, as it's pretty strange an struts application holding a reference into a Tomcat classloader.

Maybe this is because of Servlet's properties holded by Struts (during the struts-xml parsing), and a simple application doesn't have that class loaded.

If you remember in my analysis, I have two instances of jakarta's collections. I realized later on from my post that these collections are referred by the thread, and this is not done by a static variable in the thread. It's done by a class-variable in the thread.


I will try to improve ServletExample.zip in a way to use the same behavior as a Struts-servlet.","08/Apr/05 6:32 PM;clebert.suconic;I added these three lines to HttpStressTest.java, and the VM still releasing the class:
    public void init() throws ServletException {
        System.out.println(""INIT Test"");
        getServletContext().setAttribute(""Test-class"", this);
    }



So... I guess that patch created at 02-05-2005 fixed the classloading issue, but there still issues when using Jakarta collections and struts.

So Adrian, should we try a patch into struts or should we just close this issue and set the resolution as done?

If we found an application that reproduces this bug again we could reopen this issue.","08/Apr/05 7:25 PM;clebert.suconic;Forget what I said about jakarta's collections.

I did the deployment test with Specj that doesn't use any jakarta's collection.
The only think it uses is the XML reader. (but I don't think it was loaded by the deployment/init time).


So... it looks like the produced patch in Tomcat works for simple loading scenarios but still produces leaks for more complex usage scenarios.

I could or upload the profiler snapshot for you somewhere then you could navigate through the heap yourself or I could provide you access to the Specj deployment as we have license for this.


So.. I regreat on what I said about closing this issue! ;-)","11/Apr/05 4:19 PM;clebert.suconic;Adrian wrote:  What we really need is to identify the classloader

We don't have yet a WAR/EAR file that reproduces this problem besides Specj. As there is restrictions in licenses we can't of course attach it here.

Best described by example. Take three classes: Account, BillingAccount, and ProductAccount. The latter two classes inherit from the first class using the JOINED strategy. All three classes also have a @Table annotation to specify the table name. In the case of the class ""Account"", the table name is ""accounts"". In the case of the class ""BillingAccount"", the table name is ""accounts_billing"" and in the case of the class ""ProductAccount"", the table name is ""accounts_products"". 

The problem is seen in this output from the server log. Notice that the @Table attribute is honored for the superclass, but ignored for the subclasses (instead, the default table name, which is the same as the class name, is used).
